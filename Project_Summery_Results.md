# Data exploration
To be able to answer the business question, I'll perform exploration data analysis. Most of this task will be explained in the [notebook](https://github.com/plnh/Customer_Personality_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Personality%20Analysis.ipynb) in which I will classify the customers of into different segments with the purpose of understanding their needs. The steps of the analysis are below 
## 1. Analysis preparation
  - Understand data: The dataset is used to analyze customer personality. The dataset's feature an be found Here
  - Importing libraries: I used mainly numpy, pandas, and plotly
  - Data Preparation: I create new features for the dataset in order to define the customer personalities
  - Data cleaning: I identify missing values and outliners. Then I'll make decision on how to handle them
## 2. Data Exploratory: this is the main step of the analysis
  - Modeling clusters: in this step I'll organize the customers into clusters. I'll classify the customers by demographics segment. Then I'll analyzise by products to answer which customer segment tend to buy what.
  - Clusters interpretation: in this step I'll export the dataset and visualize them using tableau. The visualization can be found Here
# Results
## Findings:

- Majority of the customers who visit the site are  in their 35-65 years old and have atleast one univeristy degree. They also tend to be in a relationship and have atleast one child. 
- Although clients without children do not contribute to the majority, they mostly have high income and high spending nature.
- Customers with 1 child seems to have more income and spend more than the one with more than 1 child. 
- Educations and Material status seem have no affect to income and spending nature.
